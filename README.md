💡 Philosophy
Our experience tells us that skills are universal but oppurtunities are influenced by circumstancial enviorments. Our goal is to connect aspiring learners to the best instructors in their respective fields. Onwards!
⚠️ Limitations
Because of time constraints, we have not completed all modules. However, the first module indicates the direction project will continue by us or any developers who seeks to build on our foundation. 

Additionally, UI can be modified to be more personalized and presentable. Our main focus was on understanding the backend architecture while also reinforcing some cocepts on the front-end.
